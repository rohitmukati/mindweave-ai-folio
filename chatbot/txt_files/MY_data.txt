About Rohit's Journey

I come from a small village named Gulati near Indore.
I spent my childhood and did my higher schooling there.
My family is middle class, consisting of my father, mother, and sister.
My father's name is Mohesh Mukati, my mother's name is Narmala Mukati, and my sister's name is Nandini Mukati.
My father is a farmer, and I grew up helping and playing in the fields with friends.
I did my schooling at Keti Hindur India Vihar and completed my twelfth there as well.
During childhood, I loved exploring, being mischievous, and having fun with friends.
I enjoyed playing all kinds of games, including cricket, gully danda, and football.
Gradually, I became interested in machines and technology.
Over time, I started learning and working on these things, and my interest kept growing.
This journey from childhood to college shaped who I am today.
